    This file is part of the Opal Timing-First Microarchitectural
    Simulator, a component of the Multifacet GEMS (General 
    Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator) software toolset 
    originally developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

    Opal was originally developed by Carl Mauer based upon code by
    Craig Zilles.

    Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
    University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
    Beckmann, Jayaram Bobba, Ross Dickson, Dan Gibson, Pacia Harper,
    Milo Martin, Michael Marty, Carl Mauer, Michelle Moravan,
    Kevin Moore, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Min Xu, and Luke Yen.

/**
* A queue of instructions waiting to be dispatched to functional
* units, or other parts of the processor.
*
* There are two important components of the scheduler: the event queue,
* and a list of instructions waiting to be scheduled. The event queue
* mechanism is described more in the queueInsert() comments. Basically,
* there are two queues, one for short latency events, one for longer
* latency events. The resource limitation of the machine is modeled by
* the "Execute" command, that takes instructions from the list of
* waiting instructions (m_list_tail), and schedules their completion
* based on the instruction latencies. Instructions are added to the
* 'ready to schedule' list by the method "schedule()".
