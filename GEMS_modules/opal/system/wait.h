    This file is part of the Opal Timing-First Microarchitectural
    Simulator, a component of the Multifacet GEMS (General 
    Execution-driven Multiprocessor Simulator) software toolset 
    originally developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

    Opal was originally developed by Carl Mauer based upon code by
    Craig Zilles.

    Substantial further development of Multifacet GEMS at the
    University of Wisconsin was performed by Alaa Alameldeen, Brad
    Beckmann, Jayaram Bobba, Ross Dickson, Dan Gibson, Pacia Harper,
    Milo Martin, Michael Marty, Carl Mauer, Michelle Moravan,
    Kevin Moore, Manoj Plakal, Daniel Sorin, Min Xu, and Luke Yen.
